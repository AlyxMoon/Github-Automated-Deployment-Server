# Simple Github Deployment Server

Hey, welcome to the app! This is a personal project I've made to put on my Ubuntu webserver, which will listen to messages using [Github Webhooks](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/) in order to update apps I have configured when I update the repository on Github.

#### Setting up the app

1. Have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed
2. Have [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) or [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed
3. Download/Fork/Clone/Whatever this repository so you have it on your computer
4. Open a terminal window, make sure you are in this directory, and run `yarn` or `npm install` (whichever you want to use)
5. Start the server by running `node src/app.js` or `yarn run start` or `node run start`
6. TODO: More instructions to follow as I actually build this thing.
